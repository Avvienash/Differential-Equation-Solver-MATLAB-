# COVID-19 Data Analysis (MATLAB)

**Author:** Avvienash

## Description and Background

This GitHub repository contains a MATLAB project that focuses on performing an in-depth analysis of COVID-19 data to extract meaningful insights from a comprehensive dataset. The dataset used for this analysis is 'owid-covid-data-s3.xlsx', which contains vital information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and related metrics across multiple countries and regions. The project combines various data analysis techniques, including data importation, manipulation, visualization, polynomial regression, root-finding algorithms, and numerical integration, to extract valuable information from the data.

## Goals and Objectives

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Data Importation:** Import COVID-19 data from the provided dataset.
2. **Data Extraction:** Identify and extract key headers, including location, continent, days tracked, total cases, and total deaths.
3. **Data Visualization:** Analyze and visualize the COVID-19 data to understand trends and patterns in selected countries.
4. **Polynomial Regression:** Implement polynomial regression to model the growth of COVID-19 cases over time.
5. **Root-Finding:** Utilize root-finding algorithms to determine the time it takes for a specific country to reach a predefined total case count.
6. **Numerical Integration:** Compare and evaluate the effectiveness of different numerical integration methods (Simpson's 1/3 and 3/8 rules) for solving mathematical problems within the context of COVID-19 data.
